Project Name
Company Information Scraper

Introduction
This project is a Python program that scrapes information about companies in the USA from various websites including Google Maps, LinkedIn, and Wikipedia. The program takes a company name and address as input and generates information such as date started, website, production capacity, owner, operator, status, products, and geocoordinates. The information is then populated in Excel tables, and multiple search of company information at the same time is possible. The program has a user interface for easy use.
